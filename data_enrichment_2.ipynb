The walk to get there is around 2 km, but each step is filled with lush greenery and stunning views. The sound of the cascading water is mesmerizing. I went on a weekday, and it was peaceful. Just a heads up, the path can get slippery, so wear good shoes! Highly recommend bringing a camera for some great shots.', 'What a breathtaking experience! The hike to Bomburu Ella was invigorating, taking about 30 minutes through beautiful landscapes. When we finally reached the waterfall, it was like stepping into a postcard. There are food stalls along the way, which is a nice touch. However, I did encounter some leeches, so be prepared for that. Overall, a fantastic day out!', 'The waterfall itself is stunning, and I loved the hike. However, the path can be quite challenging in some areas, especially for families with small kids. We had a great time, but the long walk back was a bit tiring. The food stands along the way were a nice surprise, offering local snacks. Worth visiting if youre up for an adventure!', 'Bomburu Ella is truly a visual delight! The scenery during the hike is almost as beautiful as the waterfall itself. We took our time exploring the area and found some great spots for photos. Just ensure you go early to avoid crowds. The only downside was the occasional insect, but it didnt ruin the experience at all.', 'What a lovely way to spend a day! The walk to Bomburu Ella Waterfall is refreshing, and the sound of the water becomes more intense as you approach. The two main viewpoints give you a fantastic perspective. Bring plenty of water and snacks, as the return hike can be tiring. Overall, an unforgettable experience, despite a few pesky insects!'\",\n          \"'Nissanka Lata Mandapa is a stunning piece of Sri Lankan history that truly captivates. The intricate stone carvings are a sight to behold and showcase the exceptional craftsmanship of the era. Wandering through this ancient structure, I felt a deep connection to the past. The peaceful atmosphere made it a perfect spot for reflection. Just be prepared for crowds during weekends visiting during the week might offer a more serene experience.' , 'I visited Nissanka Lata Mandapa with friends, and we were all amazed by its beauty. The unique architectural design resembling a lotus is so impressive! We spent hours taking photos and exploring the carvings that tell stories of ancient Sri Lanka. Its an educational experience as well, perfect for anyone interested in history. Just wish there were more informational signs around to enhance our understanding.' , 'As a couple, we found Nissanka Lata Mandapa to be a romantic and tranquil spot amidst the historical ruins of Polonnaruwa. The intricate details on the pillars are breathtaking, providing a picturesque backdrop for our photos. However, some areas are deteriorating, which is slightly disappointing. Nevertheless, its a mustvisit for any history buff or anyone wanting to appreciate Sri Lankan architecture.' , 'I brought my family to Nissanka Lata Mandapa, and it was an enriching experience. The kids loved discovering the carvings and learning about the stories behind them. The structure itself is impressive and offers a sense of wonder. However, it can get quite busy, and parking was a challenge. Overall, a worthwhile visit that sparked interesting conversations about our heritage.' , 'Visiting Nissanka Lata Mandapa was a highlight of my trip to Polonnaruwa. The architectural design is unique and captivating. I spent time sitting in the mandapa, soaking in the history and tranquility. However, I felt that some areas could use better maintenance to preserve its beauty. Regardless, its a beautiful representation of Sri Lankas heritage and worth a stop if youre in the area.'\",\n          \"'Athugala Viharaya is a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of Kurunegala. The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking, especially during sunset. The towering Buddha statue adds a sense of peace. The road can be challenging, so I recommend taking a tuktuk if you're not confident driving. Overall, a lovely place to visit for a few hours of contemplation and stunning vistas.', 'Visiting Athugala Viharaya was a highlight of my trip to Kurunegala. The journey up was a bit steep, but the panoramic views were worth it! The statue is impressive, and the atmosphere is calming. I appreciated the small shops along the way offering local snacks. Just make sure to bring water, as there arent many facilities at the top.', 'What a peaceful place! The Athugala Viharaya offers a unique blend of spirituality and stunning views of the city. Although the path to the top can be tricky, its manageable with a little care. We went in the late afternoon, which was perfect for catching the sunset. It would be great to see more amenities around, but overall, its an enriching experience.', 'Athugala Viharaya is a hidden gem in Kurunegala. We enjoyed our visit, especially the tranquility of the site. The statue is striking, and the surrounding views are phenomenal. However, I would suggest going in the early morning to avoid the heat. While the trek up can be steep, the experience is rewarding for those who make the effort.', 'This temple has a lot to offer, though it might not be for everyone. The large Buddha statue is impressive and provides a great photo opportunity. The climb can be a bit strenuous for those not used to hiking, but families with children should be cautious. Overall, its a peaceful spot to reflect and enjoy nature, but I wish there were more dining options nearby.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

chilly wind Please do wear your trainers as the terrain is rocky and do carry a windsheater to save you from the chilly wind \\n\\nThere are three places to see  Bakers waterfall which is the shortest

are easy to climb and breathtakingly beautiful Finish it off with a cup of tea and biscuits at the canteen overlooking the plains On more practical information the entrance to the plains is an hours drive from Nuwara Elliya approximately and the tickets are slightly expensive but worth every penny Take the route on the left which reaches bakers fall last since its a better way to circle the

lacking on the cafe front I could not get any information about where the gift shop was I ended up in a branch of Laksala to use the Toilet there So it was a little haphazard on the cafe and toilet

friend and I liked to read everything but even then we were rushing through some of the final rooms because we were hungry The history is well displayed but there is a distinct hop over the period between the Kingdom of Kandy and Sri Lankas independence Since I hadnt read any other sources before the museum I had been hoping to learn what that period was like for this country and how the transition from colony to nation had gone but if it was in the museum then I missed it Overall though this place was incredible ', 'This is one of the best museums anywhere Be well rested and bring

than others and they give a great insight into the Sri Lanka history and influences We felt Rps 1000 per person was justified by the explanation quality of display and quantity of items  There are many fans in each room to cool you down and while there were a numner of people visiting on a Saturday it never felt crowded  If you have any interest in what made the island as it is today then its worth a visit time permitting', 'The self tour was good The numbered stalls give additional information so that anyone can get the required information ', 'Interesting place with some great artefacts

a con  said he did not have any change so we paid 2000 rp rather than 1200 rp', 'I love visiting museums  I think this one needs a little bit more work to bring it up to standard and in a city that is rapidly updating a lot its surprising that they havent a more modern museum  Theres way too much repetitive artifacts and not enough explanation  Theres also very little seating and after an hour you need to be able to rest your feet  It feels like the exhibits need to be updated and the flow more useful for travelers to understand the story of Sri Lanka  Its has no air conditioning either so

believe Hinduism and Buddhism are dissimilar or mutually antagonistic The museum has relatively less focus on Sri Lankas Islamic heritage\\n\\nI had gone to see the trilingual Chinese Tamil Persian stone inscription about the voyage of the great Chinese explorer Zheng He 13711433 who visited both Sri Lanka and India The inscription shows that he offered prayers to Allah Buddha and Shiva a Hindu

the end of the day in hopes of finding out a little more about the country and to see some of the artifacts illustrating the history The space itself is vast and quite old It is a cavernous series of connected rooms cooled only by standing fans filled with objects and art kept in old cases with glass panes We saw lovely original pieces and some reproductions with the originals held by the colonist countries still very sad The larger general descriptions were well written and helpful but the objects themselves were only labeled with no identifying facts which I found frustrating There were also a number of displays that were dated lifesized dioramas of jungle scenes with sound effects etc We walked and walked quickly to get upstairs before the 4pm closing time for upper floors and were stuck behind a large tour group part of the time which was very frustrating as they stood in front of important pieces not moving to let others in to see I think this is an important landmark and tourist destination that would benefit with major updates to the displays There is also a sense that the objects are not benefiting from the spaces they are kept in wondering how they are damaged by the heatlightetc If you have time and the entrance fee it is worth a visit ', 'We visited this museum as part of a shore excursion from our cruise ship that was docked in Colombo  \\n\\nThis is a large

museum that covers some of the history of Sri Lanka This room has air conditioning and seating\\n\\nSince this is a colonial building it does not have air conditioning but I found the temperature was comfortable due to cross breezes  There are no toilets in the museum building itself  However there are western toilets in the gift shop building and in annex to the main toilet building located

about the quality and the layout of the museum It was beautiful The whole of Sri Lankan history and prehistoric history as well was presented over many floors and large galleries We were blown away with the artistry and evolution of the island A great first stop in Colombo and a must see location ', 'The building is certainly impressive We found plenty to interest us for the couple of hours we spent there Some of the paintings were in very poor condition but were nevertheless worth seeing for their historical value We did rush through some of the rooms as we were short on time and wished to see as much as possible', 'Simple museum but outstanding basic educational experience of Sri Lanka I would recommend a visit to get an understanding of the general history of Sri Lanka particular from the 910 century onwards ', 'On an off travel day not a bad idea to visit to see the cultural early days of SriLanka Takes about 2 hrs for a complete visit very interesting', 'The museum is in a

rely on guess work or prior knowledge\\nThere is a lovely caf by the museum gift shop with seating outside in the courtyard which had a very European feel\\nA visit to the museum leaves you well placed for a stroll around the very pleasant Victoria Park which we did and also the adjacent Natural History Museum and art gallery which we didnt leave time for', 'Museum needs a makeover in terms

the upper rooms 40 minutes before ending time interrupting abruptly the visit without any justification except a stupid nervous smile They were eager to go on weekend as some five minutes later half an hour before 17H00 most of them were on the run\\nBad service to Sri Lanka that is a warm welcoming and interesting country\\nTherefore my evalaution reflects  the service and not the museum contents  what is a shame', 'The National Museum should be a mandatory visit for every single student in Sri Lanka in order for them not to forget where they come from and not to forget their origins which they should be proud of It gives a nice overview and comprehensive summary of the entire history through colonisation and independence However the building itself could certainly do with some urgent refurbishments because otherwise the picture of the museum building might end up in a museum\\nIndications are easy to follow but the staff in every single hall should be a bit more energetic They all were either seated on their little chair I do understand that standing up the entire day is not easy or they were on their personal phones or they were chatting with a colleague from the hall

presented and lit despite guidebook comments that it was like Colombo dusty unlit etc', 'Unfortunately when I arrived around 5 pm this place was closed but I liked the souvenir shop which was open The

get access to 2 museums One is full of historical artefacts second is more focus on natural treasures See photos one picture worths thousand words', 'Visited this museum on 1st May 2018\\nThis museum has all interesting details about the evolution of mankind and lots of details of how the early generations moved across the continents\\n\\nThey play a short movie at the entrance right side\\n\\nThe entry ticket is 1200 LKR for foreigners\\n', 'Very knowledgeable thing you can see there in Museum \\nMany historical things you can see there \\nVery helpful staff on duty there to assist you \\n', 'This museum is gorgeous the building is magnificent and the artifacts are interesting however it is so hot inside it is hard to stay long enough to enjoy anything \\nThey have pedestal fans but are generally pointed at the staff that work there and not enough to cool you down\\nThey had also recently painted some fixtures and it was still wet but no wet paint signs were put up and I had black paint on my legs\\n\\nDisappointed that I couldnt enjoy the history here as it was just too hot to bare', 'The National Museum is housed in a massive building with huge halls and you really need a couple of hours to see everything Some of the displays are dusty and dated but numerous exhibition areas were refurbished just a few years ago  lots of English language display descriptions that helped us put the artifacts into historical context from the earliest human settlements rule by kings various invasions and occupations and eventually independence Huge collections of coins pottery religious items Stone sculpture and everyday items from across the ages If you heading for any of the historiccultural sites across Sri Lanka this is a good orientation to when the sites were in use and why they were important at the time Just a minor complaint very little signage to help visitors move from gallery to gallery its not always clear where to go Fortunately there is a guard in almost every hall who can point the way\\n', 'It is worth visiting the building to see the 1877 architecture even if you dont specifically tour the museum There is a statue of the museum founder Sir William Gregory in the grounds and a spectacular banyan tree There is also an excellent staterun gift and jewellery shop and a cafe which are all worth a visit 3045 minutes without a museum tour', 'We enjoyed a day sightseeing as part of our cruise Vibrant place with some great buildings Hot and humid walking around so take a towel', 'Visited here as part on our Colombo tour and enjoy it well worth a visit  Well laid out with plenty to see', 'National museum in every country should be one of the best point of attraction to visit this museum is to visit by every one some part of it is even interesting for children', 'This is a great museum and worthy of your time to explore and gain an in depth understanding of the Sri Lankan history and culture  What a wonderful country\\n\\nOh there is a decent coffee shop close to the exit for those like me love coffee ', 'Two storeys of 1877 colonial style huge building houses the Museum which has elaborate displays ranging from natural sciences history and culture Innumerable artefacts  are indeed enthralling prehistoric to Kandyan exhibits Ate great Remember it is a heritage structure so devoid of modern aircon facilities\\n\\nA huge outlet called the Souvenir and gift shops has very reasonably priced local stuff The coffee shop near the billing counter offers discounts on edibles and coffee over the Museum purchases bills', 'Located in an imposing colonial building the museum traces the history of Sri LankaCelyon from prehistory to recent times  An excellent collection of artefacts a very well organised walk through time with an emphasis of the kingdoms up to colonial times\\ni was somewhat disappointed that little was said of British colonial times and the following independence and recent history\\nVisitors do need to be aware that there is a big difference in entry fees for tourists and locals fair enough given the wealth difference  Travel by tuktuk is easy from any of the major hotels', 'You can get a ticket for the National museum and the Natural History museum hidden behind the main museum with no signage\\nWouldnt recommend the Natural History museum as it has very tired looking exhibits in an even hotter environment than the main museum\\n\\nYou need a few hours to take in everything in the National museum Pause in front of the fans to read the info\\n\\n2 minutes is too long in the Natural History museum Little signage to help you navigate the maze', 'It should be on the top of your goto places if you love history There are various sections in the museum that keep you intrigued and wanting for more', 'The place is huge so take some time with you if you plan to visit Lots to see from different periods of Sri Lankan history ', 'The Museum might not have anything special but its worth a look if you are a museum person looking at historical artifact The route and rooms are very well organised and the staff there will direct you in the right direction if you are lost Wellmaintained museum', 'If you have a full itinerary I would probably skip this museum Cost was 8 and I didnt think it was worth it I spent about an hour inside The artifacts and paintings were beautiful It provided a nice history of Sri Lanka but I was really bored for most of it If you have lots of time in Colombo and LOVE history then you will enjoy it If you are limited on time definitely skip it Bring your camera because the outside is beautiful', 'This museum is very comprehensive in giving a good insight into the development of Sri Lanka There are a wide range of exhibits with generally good labelling in English We recommend spending at least 30 minutes each in the first two rooms as this sets the scene for the rest of the exhibition', 'Well worth a visit and if you have a few hours take your time There are a huge amount of exhibits but nothing from the 20th century ', 'This is a large museum on two floors with excellent pieces of ancient and more modern items too The labelling is generally very good if you speak English The museum has none of the interactive displays that a modern museum would have but it is still very interesting and well worth a visit\\n\\nThe authorities need to invest in better facilitiesthe toilets are appalling and the cafe is poor Considering the high standard of cafes nearby such as The Commons I was disappointed\\n\\nAs an introduction to the culture of the country I think a visit to this place is essential It is open every day except public holidays If you buy a ticket you are allowed to exit and return on the same day\\n\\nHighlights are the prehistoric tombs carved stone statues and columns ceremonial throne and weapons textiles', 'The Colombo National Museum details Sri Lanka ancient past and its colonial periods  although it seeks to create the impression was the island was uninhabited before the arrival of the Sinhalese It is well worth visiting the museum as a prelude to visiting the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa  ', 'This was beautifully set up and well worth a trip  English translation very good and exhibits very interesting', 'Amazing Collection We did a lot of touring around Sri Lanka and saw plenty of ancient architectural and archaeological sites So we went here on our last day in Sri Lanka to help tie everything together However people say its a great intro cultural  collection to the country But also a nice farewell ', 'If you are interested in the history of Sri Lanka you should go the this museum It will provide you with a brief introduction on the country and her history Note the recent history is not really added to the collection yet Beautiful building and gardens around the museum Note entrance ticket price seems to be flexible ', 'Large museum in impressive old building with nice grounds Displays were well laid out and sign posted to walk around in order Was hot inside the museum and the toilets were outside', 'Visited this place when I had a few hours to kill in Colombo\\n\\nThe entrance fee of Rs1000 was too high in my opinion\\n\\nThe collections of the museum vary from very average to somewhat interesting  Some more contemporary displays would have been nice\\n\\nForeigners beware of the cafeteria  I asked for a chocolate drink that I was told cost Rs150  Paid 500 but was shortchanged by 100  I had to ask for this extra money Moreover upon finishing the drink I noticed it was labelled 50 not 150  Again I had to request that I be given an extra 100 back that I was duly owed  The two apologies from the cashier were very insincere and it is therefore regrettable to experience the extent to which they went to try and rip me a foreign tourist off  This is from a government owned museum  Shameful\\n\\nUpon leaving I was asked to complete a survey  Apparently staff members within the exhibitions are meant to chat to you about their various displays however I can only say this was the case with 1 single staff member\\n\\nNevertheless the woman conducting the survey was very friendly and provided me with very detailed instructions on taking the bus back to my hotel  This was a very positive note to end on', 'The museum is in an impressive old building and grounds Inexpensive entry Linear walk round well presented displays with some interesting items Well worth a visit if you arrive in Colombo and before you head out to explore the country and its historical sites Was quiet when we toured', 'Rs 1000 per person will get you into this stately building and its well organized halls containing a vast collection of artifacts from ancient and colonial history Unfortunately it does stop there and you do not learn about contemporary Sri Lanka Thankfully the collection is neatly partitioned thematically and chronologically so that you can pick and chooseand choose you must', 'The Colombo National Museum is a treasure worth visiting Allow enough time if you like history 2 stories of treasures about Sri Lanka The National Museum houses 4000 palm leaf manuscripts coins guns and weapons art and the history of early man Worth a visit ', 'Plenty of historical artefacts to see aswell as beautiful sculptures The museum has a lot of view and read about ', 'This was only our 2nd day in Sri Lanka and before we made our way up country it was a chance to understand the early history of Sri Lanka and how some of the places we planned to visit fit together It was housed in lovely building and was set out with 15 different rooms It was easy to understand the different periods Sri Lanka has gone through and as we were going to Anuradhapura the next day gave us some ideas what to see including  the early method of irrigation by building 3 tanks\\nWe spent over 2 hours and really enjoyed it It cost LKR 1000 for an adult ', 'This is the best place to learn the Sri Lankan history There are lot of things to read and see over here I really liked the new room dedicated to the Silk Road and the Chinese Shi dynasty who were originally Sri Lankan who went to to China and settled in The tour takes around 3 hours and parking is available ', 'I did enjoy learning more about Sri Lanka by visiting this museum Theres no air conditioner but fans inside kept the air flowing Exhibits give a good window into life and culture from prehistoric to near modern times Scale models also demonstrate the advanced engineering they used centuries ago ', 'By world standards a very average museum\\nWe paid 1000 rupee each to visit tourists pay locals dont Its almost an Ikea experience where once you start you cant get out until you have past everything\\nThere are 2 buildings in the complex and I would have thought an entrance ticket to the museum would have been to both buildings but no you then have to pay another 400 rupee to get into the second building\\nAt the original ticket office this was not explained where we could have purchased a multi ticket for 1200\\nThe money was not an issue basically just a tourist ripoff and we will not be part of it', 'Good place to learn more about the history of Sri Lanka Huge collection of Buddha statues and artefacts with English explanation house in a beautiful Colonial Style building Need at least one hour LKR1000 for one museum and LKR1200 for combination of 2 museums Really worth a visit', 'Quite interesting to see some of the artefacts in the museum Well layed out and easy to navigate They have an app you can down load on the museum but I could only get the begining to work but that is probably my fault as I am not very tech savvy Wouldnt say it is a must see but we had two days in Colombo so was good to do for 12 hours and then visit beautiful Viharamahadevi park', 'Though Colombo is far from the most attractive location in Sri Lanka to visit dont skip it or at least reserve half a day to visit the National Museum there There are hardly any museums in the country and those which are there have a limited collection which isnt always best preserved Those artifacts which didnt end up in a foreign museum are more or less assembled in the National Museum in Colombo Therefore one gets the best impression of Sri Lankas ancient history in Colombo', 'The exhibits are quite good in this very traditional museum  Its not really kid friendly but history buffs will find it well worth a visit', 'Colombo National Museum is a good start point for knowing Sri Lanka and its history The Museum is full of artifacts from different Lankan eras Although I spent 67 hours in the Museum and tried to read as many posted placards on history as possible yet I couldnt get enough of this beautiful countrys glorious past and ups  downs over the centuries\\n\\nDespite the fact that Museum wasnt air conditioned and Sri Lankan sultry weather couldnt be tamed by those old colonial pedestal fans being used inside the museum we still enjoyed the visit and learned a fair deal about Sri Lanka\\n\\nHuge collection of Buddha statues coins ceramic daggers bows  arrows swords guns silverware jewelry etc lie in wait for admirers and history buffs  students \\n\\nThe entry fee SL Rupee 1000 seem a bit high for one Museum 2nd one is small and not much to see Museum building is spread over great acreage with its magnificent white color Lot needs to be done to add beauty and prestige that this Museum deserves More detail on each item will definitely benefit and interactive touch screen will help visitors to learn more about Sri Lanka and its history\\n\\nHowever as it is its worth visiting if one is in Colombo \\n\\n', 'We had a couple of hours to spend in Colombo and decided to visit the national museum   Overall the exhibits are organised well with good explanations of the different artefacts  We only had time to cover the ground floor visiting the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa era galleries but there was more than enough here to keep our kids engaged for the time we visited  We had to promise a return trip to see the rest to get them to leave when our time was up\\n\\nOnly minor gripe was that the galleries could be better ventilated with more fans  It could get quite hot in places \\n\\nThe museum is convenient to drive to with good parking on site that was easy to access  ', 'Great place to learn about Sri Lankan heritage I highly recommend a visit here You can learn a lot about Sri Lankan culture and heritage', 'colombo national museum located in albert crescent road  vast area and has a good collection  to know about countrys culture and history  museum is best place its good  but i dont find it interesting  so i wont regret if i would have skip it ', 'I was keen to learn more about this fascinating country but much of the history on display is about Budda which is pretty much the same story as in all the other Asian Buddhist countries\\n\\nSaying this it is still worth a visit as the museum building is beautiful and there are some interesting snippets of Sri Lankan history I enjoyed learning about  cost is very reasonable around 7', 'We arrived at the National Museum from the rear and bought the combined entry tickets at the Natural History Museum A short walk around that museum made us wonder if we had wasted our money with tired displays of stuffed animals and half the museum seemingly closed off so it was a degree of trepidation that we walked around to the National Museum However we were pleasantly surprised to find a really good and informative museum Most of the galleries had been refurbished over the last 10 years and the exhibits and information filled in a lot of gaps from our earlier visits to historic sights in Sri Lanka Clearly there is a bit more to go though as the final three rooms were back to the Natural History Museum standard with almost no information on the interesting items in the rooms  All in all though worth a visit ', 'You can find different displays in this musea statues from all over the country and from different centuries but also paintings coins battle equipment agriculture equipment masks\\nDone with child who also enjoyed the different rooms', 'Nice place that you have to visit when you are in Colombo It might be a bit boring but its gives you a better understanding of Sri Lanka and its history ', 'The exhibits here provide an insight into more than 2000 years of Sri Lankan history This provides a great context to understand the country but also displays some incredible objects in every gallery A rare treat at approx 10 ', 'We passed a fun few hours here with 3 kids 6 5 and 1 It is a grand building worth seeing in itself Tickets were inexpensive 1000 per adult 500 per child above 6 I think as we only paid for our eldest Some stairs not certain if access is easy for wheelchair users on that basis but perhaps there is a lift we missed \\n\\nI loved the textiles and specifically came to view them The kids were astounded by the stone statuary and we now have a whole new set of bed time questions are Buddha and God good pals Who is the eldest Why do goddesses have 6 arms but I dont They had some interesting ceramics but the level of information was frustrating at points Many items had no age origin description etc and it would have been great to know more about how the different pieces of china came to sri lanka Who used them Where were the items found You see lots of more modern copies of the same designs in Sri Lankawhat are the differences in ages and which nationality made the copies \\nAlthough in general thr museum could provide a lot more information and context for the exhibitions we still really enjoyed it There is even a good cafe for sustenance afterwards Dont miss the rickshawcart display outside by the cafe', 'Loved the variety of historical painting and costume artefacts Not too busy and lots of information about each area ', 'This a well laidout display of important parts of  Srilankan history The display starts from the Paleolithic era and ends at the recent past 19301940 The most impressive part for me as a visitor was from the 12th century until colonisation by Portugal If I remember correctly there are some stone works in section 3 This area gives a good overview of how and why stone works were important at that time They has been used largely to store information for example land ownership taxation rights demarcation points and etc Also in day to day live example toilets baths The details the precision the tools available and the material used gives an idea about the knowledge level at that time The adjacent display was based on craft jewellery  weaponry and artefacts There is a small section dedicated for jewellery worn by kings and queens It is truly breathtaking The artists have taken extraordinary care to preserve the original structure of gems embedded they have handmade minute links connected in multiple dimensions Some of those jewels are currently in fashion but they are nowhere near what was achieved at that time You have to see it to understand This whole room contains the Srilankan craft heritage Since craft and artistic excellence is a demonstration of how advanced the society is the ordinary population seems to have lived in a sophisticated healthy society during this time You will have to allocate three hours to view this complete display', 'Nice place to take some photos and visit the Sri Lanka history A big big tree live there for more than 100 years', 'We enjoyed it here the museum is very large and extensive with some lovely displays and Interesting history write ups etc The museum is very well maintained and clean throughout Lots of school children which was cute but got a bit crowded in particular areas I would however recommend going to the restroom in your hotel as the public facilities are very poor and very unhygienic and you have to walk all the way outside near the main entrance to access them so dont lose your entrance ticket Despite that we enjoyed our time here and would recommend if museums are your thing', 'An eclectic mix of things to learn about Sri Lanka Some great stuff along with the more mundane Some of the masks were amazing\\nDefinitely worth a stop', 'Interesting building however attractiveness of exhibition cant compete with museums in other places Europe US  Canada Japan  ', 'Lots of absolutely fascinating artifacts packed into one building This is a good place to start before touring Sri Lanka since it will provide some basic information regarding the different empires and their geographies\\n\\nAs a agricultural geek i was particularly impressed with the working mockup of the ancient tank system and the sacred harvesting circle which i was lucky enough to experience in real life during my trip\\n\\nDefinitely helps to situate some of the sites that you will probably come across during your trip and even enables us outsiders to consider how history has shaped contemporary Sri Lankan culture \\n\\nAmazing to see the Roman coins and Viking artifacts Evidence that ancient cultures were strongly interconnected through the Silk Road', 'This is a wonderful museum with a great many artefacts The only downside is that once you start you have to complete the circuit There is no way out from the middle We had a melt down with a child with no way to exit and so had to keep going With smaller children be sure to carry snacks and water definitely not stroller friendly', 'We took a tuktuk to the museum they are quite wellknown Then after that we got on another tuktuk and went to Odel department store which was about 900m1km away\\n\\nThere are some exhibits that are more wellmaintained and welllit than others  the weaponspotterytools exhibit is renovated and looks good the rest of the museum is more old but i love the colonial vibe of the building \\n\\nNote that there is no airconditioning we went on a rainy day so it was alright \\n\\nIm not a historyinclined person so i didnt really enjoy it but those who are will as there is so much explanation to read Not really kidsfriendly though\\n\\nI like how the museum flows  they label each exhibit area with numbers and you just follow them each exhibit has an exit that leads to another eg 1 history 2 culture etc and in the end you wind up at the exit which has a nice air conditioned large souvenir shop with benches you can sit and some drinks or light snacks you can order the toilets at the shop are also not too shabby', 'I do not recommend visiting the museum It is very hot there no AC The poster are very basic elementary school science project level in the smaller building The explanations in the nicer building are not very clear It takes quite a long time to go around and once you start there is no short cut to finish the visit earlier so you have to go through the whole thing I did not really learn anything there Only go there if you do not have anything else to do On the positive side the big white building is very pretty', 'Excellent collections of art and artifacts depicting the richness of Sri Lankan history and culture but the discriminatory  prejudicial pricing was horrific Seeing local students allowed to enter at decent and fair prices while foreign students were forced to pay multiples more was a souring experience Adding insult to injury wealthy Sri Lankans were afforded entry at small fractions of what foreigners from developing countries and backpackers on small budgets were required to pay This prejudicial  and highly discriminatory approach to pricing must be discarded in the interest of fairness Either charge everyone the same price  or charge nobody anything at all And if one wishes to discriminate then do so on the basis of ones ability to pay allowing individuals to selfreport and give what they can This would be the most fair'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The tea tasting was informative, but I expected more from the flavor. Overall, it felt like a tourist trap rather than an authentic experience. Definitely not worth the long journey.','While the scenery was beautiful, I found Nuwara Eliya to be quite underwhelming. The horse shows were lackluster, and the golf course was poorly maintained. I had hoped for more outdoor adventures, but most activities felt rushed and overpriced. The only highlight was a lovely afternoon tea, but it didn't save the trip for me.','Nuwara Eliya has potential, but it fell short during my visit. The tea tasting session was informative, but the options were limited. Horseback riding was enjoyable, although the guides lacked enthusiasm. I think there are better places in Sri Lanka that offer a more authentic experience.','I had high hopes for Nuwara Eliya, but it was somewhat disappointing. The golf course was nice but crowded, and the horseback riding was not as exciting as I anticipated. The views were stunning, but the overall atmosphere felt commercialized. I would recommend doing more research before visiting.','As a family, we found Nuwara Eliya to be a mixed bag. The kids enjoyed the horse shows, but we felt the activities were overpriced for what they offered. The tea tasting was a nice touch, but we expected more interaction. It was a pleasant getaway, but I wouldnt rush back.'\""
